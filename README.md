DocPad plugin that mounts bower components in web server middleware (currently
only JS components)



## Install

It's not available for neat installation yet. But you can grab
[source](https://github.com/sergeylukin/docpad-plugin-bowermount/archive/master.zip)
and extract it into `plugins/` inside your docpad project

Hopefully soon it will be available via:

```
docpad install bowerrequirejs
```
